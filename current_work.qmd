### Pollination service and blueberry production in Argentina

\

During the last five years my research has been focused on understanding how spatial patterns interact with farming practices to modulate the provision and contribution of pollination service to blueberries production. Specifically I studied (and continue studying):

:::{}
i. Mechanisms driving the effect of animal pollination on the fruit production, fruit quality and nutritional content.

ii. Optimal pollination thresholds to maximize blueberry production.

iii. Individual and population effectiveness of birds and insects pollinating blueberries.

iv. Cascading processes affecting pollination service, from landscape to farming area.

### A control systems for managing pollination service in blueberries

Pollination management in pollinator-dependent crops generally depends on beehives stocked at variable densities. Farmers typically seek to saturate crop flowers with pollinators, while giving little consideration to how different stocking densities actually affect flower-visitation rates and optimal pollination levels depending on the mating crop system. Such an approach would be unthinkable in the case of other crop inputs. Still, although pollination is crucial for securing crop yields and profits, its management is generally based on much more ambiguous criteria, leading to uncertainties about its outcome and actual benefits. In this project I aim to combine different modelling techniques to predict blueberry production based on strength, density and spatial arrangement of honeybee hives in the farm, honeybee pollination effectiveness, and optimal levels and patterns of pollen deposition in the crop. 

This project is part of my current postdoctoral work under the supervision of [Dr Pedro G. Blendinger](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9oyNtX0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Dr Natacha Chacoff](https://scholar.google.com.ar/citations?user=rxJBqGcAAAAJ&hl=en).
