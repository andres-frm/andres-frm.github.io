    "text": "Hi!\nI’m a postdoctoral researcher of CONICET at the Institute of Regional Ecology in Tucumán, Argentina. I was born in Colombia and started my career hoping to become an agronomist, but somehow I ended up as a biologist interested in mammalian ecology. In 2018 I got a Ph.D. fellowship to study crop pollination at Northwestern Argentina; since then, I have been enjoying asado, mate, empanadas and, of course, the 40 °C during Tucumán’s summer.\nI created this website to share my work and my general interests outside academic formality.\n\n\nMy current research\nI am interested in combining different modeling approaches and field experiments to understand how spatial patterns affect biodiversity and ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes. Currently, I’m mainly involve in two projects : (i) developing a control system for pollination service management in blueberry crops, and (ii) assessing how low opportunity cost areas in large-scale monoculture of citrus can boost taxonomic and functional diversity of pollinators.\n\n\nMy research interests\n\nFunctional diversity and ecosystem services\nPollinators and mammals\nLandscape ecology\nExperimental design\nData science\nStatistical programming\n\n\n\nWhat I like/love\n\nBiking.\nReading (Dostoyevski, García Márquez, Sábato, and Vasili Grossman are personal friends).\nAsado –or BBQ in english– (Despite the ethical conflict inside me, I’m a big meat eater).\nDark beer (preferably Stout).\nAnimals in general, but particularly bats, cats and dogs.\n\n\n\n\nMy family (from left to right), Natalia, Iris, and Ziggy"
