    "text": "Hi!\nI’m a postdoctoral researcher of CONICET at the Institute of Regional Ecology in Tucumán, Argentina. I was born in Colombia and started my career hoping to become an agronomist, but somehow I ended up as a biologist interested in mammalian ecology. In 2018 I got a Ph.D. fellowship to study crop pollination at Northwestern Argentina; since then, I have been enjoying asado, mate, empanadas and, of course, the 40 °C during Tucumán’s summer.\nI created this website to share my work and my general interests outside academic formality.\n\n\nCurrent research\nI am interested in combining different modeling approaches and field experiments to understand how spatial patterns affect biodiversity and ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes. Currently, I’m mainly involve in two projects : (i) developing a control system for pollination service management in blueberry crops, and (ii) assessing how low opportunity cost areas in large-scale monoculture of citrus can boost taxonomic and functional diversity of pollinators.\n\n\nResearch interests\n\nFunctional diversity and ecosystem services\nPollinators and mammals\nLandscape ecology\nExperimental design\nData science\nStatistical programming\n\n\n\nWhat I like/love\n\nBiking.\nReading (Dostoyevski, García Márquez, Sábato, and Vasili Grossman are personal friends).\nAsado –or BBQ in english– (Despite the ethical conflict inside me, I’m a big meat eater).\nDark beer (preferably Stout).\nAnimals in general, but particularly bats, cats and dogs.\n\nMy Family\n\n\n\n\nMe and Natalia\n\n\n\n\n\nIris (left) and Ziggy (rigth)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Note: The Internet has plenty of outstanding sources and textbooks written in English addressing similar, if not the same, topics of this blog. Instead of continuing to saturate this market, I prefer to increase the volume of available information in a different language. Therefore, I only wrote the introduction of the blog in English, headers are in both English and Spanish, but the content is only provided in my mother language.\n\n\n\nBack in ~2014, I remember myself struggling to analyze my data using SPSS 20, PAST, and plotting figures in SigmaPlot. I was confused and worried by the ‘abnormality’ of my data, praying to the old and the new gods for a p-value&lt;0.05, without understanding coefficients, their uncertainty, and implications for my conclusions. JJust madness. As time went by, the conceptual and methodological black boxes got smaller —I started coding and using GLM(M). Still, only when I got in touch with Bayesian statistics was when I felt a deeper understanding of statistics. Bayesian approach makes probability more intuitive, offers a unified conceptual framework for data analysis, is more flexible and powerful for fitting complex models. All this comes at the cost of higher computational demand and programming skills (nothing arcane), but it brings a deeper understanding of the machinery inside the black box you are using; it makes you freer!\nI use RPubs for sharing and explaining to others and myself, how to fit statistical models and extract insights from data. The content is structured from the most basic statistical model (the mean, \\(\\mu\\)) to the more complex ones (hierarchical or multilevel models). I also provide R programming tutorials (e.g. data and programming structures, functions, simulations, graphics, etc), and a miscellaneous section with random stuffs.\nFinally, I am responsible for all hits and misses. Feel free to contact me if you detect mistakes, misunderstandings, or ways to improve any section.\nHopefully, this will be helpful for someone.\n¡Un abrazo!\nAndrés\n\nR programming\n\n\nBayes statistics\n\n\nMiscelaneus\n\nDescribing and comparing activity patterns in animals**\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
