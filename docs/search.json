Tucumán, Argentina.\n\n\nPollination management in pollinator-dependent crops generally depends on beehives stocked at variable densities. Farmers typically seek to saturate crop flowers with pollinators, while giving little consideration to how different stocking densities actually affect flower-visitation rates and optimal pollination levels depending on the mating crop system. Such an approach would be unthinkable in the case of other crop inputs. Still, although pollination is crucial for securing crop yields and profits, its management is generally based on much more ambiguous criteria, leading to uncertainties about its outcome and actual benefits. In this project, I aim to combine different modeling techniques to predict blueberry production based on the strength, density, and spatial arrangement of honeybee hives on the farm, honeybee pollination effectiveness, and optimal levels and patterns of pollen deposition in the crop.\nThis project is part of my current postdoctoral work under the supervision of Dr. Pedro G. Blendinger and Dr. Natacha Chacoff.\n\n\nLow opportunity cost areas in large-scale monoculture for pollinator conservation\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge-scale monoculture of citrus and Andean forest at the Northwestern Argentina.\n\n\nArgentina is one of the leading countries producing citrus, and the Northwestern of the country has the largest cultivated area. Consequently, during the last decades, the agricultural landscape of this region has been severely transformed, being dominated by large-scale monocultures of citrus at the Andean piedmont, followed by non-flowering crops of sugar cane and soybean. Here, we aim to study how non-cultivated areas within citrus farms can boost pollinators’ diversity. Specifically, we want to assess how different facets of pollinator diversity are affected by floral resources (composition and abundance), crop margins, and natural areas. Moreover, we aim to disentangle the mechanisms promoting pollinators pollinators persistence within the crop.\nThis project is conducted in partnership with the NGO Proyungas and lead by Dr. Carolina Monmmany, Dr. Natacha Chacoff, Dr. Roxana Aragón, and me.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Hi!\nI’m a postdoctoral researcher of CONICET at the Institute of Regional Ecology in Tucumán, Argentina. I was born in Colombia and started my career hoping to become an agronomist, but somehow I ended up as a biologist interested in mammalian ecology. In 2018 I got a Ph.D. fellowship to study crop pollination at Northwestern Argentina; since then, I have been enjoying asado, mate, empanadas and, of course, the 40 °C during Tucumán’s summer.\nI created this website to share my work and my general interests outside academic formality.\n\n\nCurrent research\nI am interested in combining different modeling approaches and field experiments to understand how spatial patterns affect biodiversity and ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes. Currently, I’m mainly involve in two projects : (i) developing a control system for pollination service management in blueberry crops, and (ii) assessing how low opportunity cost areas in large-scale monoculture of citrus can boost taxonomic and functional diversity of pollinators.\n\n\nResearch interests\n\nFunctional diversity and ecosystem services\nPollinators and mammals\nLandscape ecology\nExperimental design\nR programming\nData science\nBayesian statistics\n\n\n\nWhat I like/love\n\nBiking.\nLiterature (Dostoyevski, García Márquez, Sábato, and Vasili Grossman are personal friends).\nAsado –BBQ in english.\nDark beer.\nAnimals in general, but particularly bats, cats and dogs.\n\nMy Family\n\n\n\n\nMe and Natalia\n\n\n\n\n\nIris (left) and Ziggy (rigth)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

Instead of continuing to saturate this market, I prefer to increase the volume of available information in a different language. Therefore, I only wrote the introduction of the blog in English, headers are in both English and Spanish, but the content is only provided in my mother language.\n\n\n\nBack in ~2014, I remember myself struggling to analyze my data using SPSS, PAST, and plotting figures in SigmaPlot. I was confused and worried by the ‘abnormality’ of my data, praying to the old and the new gods for a p-value&lt;0.05, without understanding coefficients, their uncertainty, and implications for my conclusions. A completely nonsense. As time went by, the conceptual and methodological black boxes got smaller —I started coding and using GLM(M). Still, only when I got in touch with Bayesian statistics was when I felt a deeper understanding of statistics. Bayesian approach makes probability more intuitive, offers a unified conceptual framework for data analysis, is more flexible and powerful for fitting complex models. All this comes at the cost of higher computational demand and programming skills (nothing arcane), but it brings a deeper understanding of the machinery inside the black box you are using; it makes you freer!\nI use RPubs for sharing and explaining to others and myself, how to fit statistical models and extract insights from data. The content is structured from the most basic statistical model (the mean, \\(\\mu\\)) to the more complex ones (hierarchical or multilevel models). I also provide R programming tutorials (e.g. data and programming structures, functions, simulations, graphics, etc), and a miscellaneous section with random stuffs.\nI am responsible for all hits and misses. Feel free to contact me if you detect mistakes, misunderstandings, or ways to improve any section.\nHopefully, this will be helpful for someone.\n¡Un abrazo!\n\nR programming\n\n\nBayes statistics\n\n\nDistribuciones de probabilidad y ejemplos en R(Probability distributions and examples in R)\nIntroducción a los modelos lineales generalizados (GLM) (Introduction to generalized linear models (GLM))\nIntroducción a los modelos jerárquicos I (Introduction to hierarchical models I)\n\n\n\n\nMiscelaneus\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
