    "text": "Hi!\nI’m postdoctoral researcher of CONICET at the Institute of Regional Ecology in Tucumán, Argentina. I was born in Colombia and started my career hoping to become an agronomist, but somehow I ended up as a biologist interested in mammalian ecology. In 2018 I got a Ph.D. fellowship by CONICET to study crop pollination at Northwestern Argentina; since then, I have been enjoying asado, mate, empanadas and, of course, the 40 °C during Tucumán’s summer.\nI built this website to share my work and my general interests outside academic formality.\n\n\nMy current research\nCurrently, I am interested in combining different modeling approaches and field experiments to understand how spatial patterns affect biodiversity and ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes of Northern Argentina. I’m mainly studying: the effect of animal pollination on several productive metrics of the crop; optimal pollination thresholds to maximize blueberry production; individual and population effectiveness of pollinators; and cascading processes affecting pollination service in blueberry crops.\n\n\nMy research interests\n\nCrop pollination\nPollination ecology\nBats\nFunctional diversity\nStatistics\nR programming\n\nI’m interested in understanding how spatial patterns modulate the functional responses of animals and the resulting effect on ecosystem processes.\n\n\nWhat I like/love\n\nBiking.\nReading (Dostoyevski, García Márquez, Sábato, and Vasili Grossman are personal friends).\nAsado –or BBQ in english– (Despite the ethical conflict inside me, I’m a big meat eater).\nDark beer (preferably Stout).\nAnimals in general, but particularly bats, cats and dogs.\n\n\n\n\nIris (left) and Ziggy (right)"
