Instead of continuing to saturate this market, I prefer to increase the volume of available information in a different language. Therefore, I only wrote the introduction of the blog in English, headers are in both English and Spanish, but the content is only provided in my mother language.\n\n\n\nBack in ~2014, I remember myself struggling to analyze my data using SPSS, PAST, and plotting figures in SigmaPlot. I was confused and worried by the ‘abnormality’ of my data, praying to the old and the new gods for a p-value&lt;0.05, without understanding coefficients, their uncertainty, and implications for my conclusions —a completely nonsense. As time went by, the conceptual and methodological black boxes got smaller —I started coding and using GLM(M). Still, only when I got in touch with the Bayesian framework was when I felt a deeper understanding of statistics. Bayesian approach makes probability more intuitive, offers a unified conceptual framework for data analysis, is more flexible and powerful for fitting complex models. All this comes at the cost of higher computational demand and programming skills (nothing arcane), but it brings a deeper understanding of the machinery inside the black box you are using.\nI use RPubs for sharing and explaining to others and myself, how to fit statistical models and extract insights from data. The content is structured from the most basic statistical model (the mean, \\(\\mu\\)) to the more complex ones (hierarchical or multilevel models).

    "text": "Hi!\nI’m a postdoctoral researcher at the Ecological Interactions Lab led by Dr. Jef Vizentin-Bugoni (Institute of Biology, UFPel) in Pelotas (RS), Brazil. I was born in Colombia and started my career hoping to become an agronomist, but somehow I ended up as a biologist interested in community ecology, species interaction, ecosystem processes, and ecological modeling.\nI created this website to share my work and my general interests outside academic formality.\n\n\nResearch topic\nI am an ecologist with a deep curiosity for understanding how species interactions and functional diversity mediate ecological processes. My background has involved mammals, birds, and pollinators as model systems and the use of quantitative methods and field experiments to address my questions. During my PhD, I studied the mechanisms that regulate the contribution of pollinators to the production of pollination-dependent crops in Argentina (South America). This research had a deep focus on developing management strategies for the pollination service to improve crop productivity. I am a collaborator in projects studying how within-farm spatial management can promote pollinator conservation in large-scale crops, and the factors modulating the local congregation of honeybee males in agricultural landscapes. Currently, I am mainly involved in two projects: (i) disentangling biotic and abiotic factors affecting non-trophic interactions of tropical birds in Panama (Army Ant Followers Project), and (ii) exploring the mechanisms explaining temporal dynamics of seed dispersal networks in Hawaii (Hawaii-VINE. Project).

    "text": "Current projects\n\nMechanisms explaining temporal dynamics of seed dispersal networks in island ecosystems (2025-current)\n \nEcological communities are dynamic organizations of organisms whose structure is a function of environmental and biological cycles affecting species composition and abundance. Such ecological regularities affect species interactions due to changes in the availability of suitable interaction partners, which ultimately impacts ecological processes in which the species are involved. We know little about the temporal dynamic of species interactions, and we lack a mechanistic understanding of how climatic regularities interact with the biological responses of the species to explain the structure of ecological networks. In this project, we will address these questions by studying seed dispersal networks in Hawaiian islands.\nMy work is part of a much larger project studying novel ecosystems, which involves several researchers and institutions (visit the website of the Hawaii VINE Project). But I am more closely working with Dr. Jef Vizentin-Bugoni, Dr. Corey Tarwater and Dr. J. Patrick Kelley.\nHere are some related papers produced by Jef, Patrick, and Corey:\n\n\nVizentin-Bugoni, J., Tarwater, C. E., Foster, J. T., Drake, D. R., Gleditsch, J. M., Hruska, A.

Such factors operate at particular temporal scales and involve synergies that drive community structure and ecosystem functioning. In this research, we studied how the direct and indirect effects of biotic and abiotic factors affected the structure of non-trophic interaction networks in tropical forests. To do so, we used ant-follower birds as a model system: a bird aggregation specialized in following army ants to increase its foraging efficiency.\nThis research is part of the project Army Ant Followers Project led by Dr. Corey Tarwater and Dr. J. Patrick Kelley. Overall, we use observational and manipulative experiments and advanced modeling techniques to understand the factors responsible for structuring ant-followers groups in Panama’s tropical forest.\nYou can find a press article about the project here, and a very nice video about the fieldwork here.\nThis research is part of my work at the Ecological Interactions Lab led by Dr. Jef Vizentin-Bugoni.\n\n\nLow opportunity cost areas in large-scale monoculture for pollinator conservation (2023-current)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge-scale monoculture of citrus and Andean forest at the Northwestern Argentina.\n\n\nArgentina is one of the leading countries producing citrus, and the Northwestern of the country has the largest cultivated area. Consequently, during the last decades, the agricultural landscape of this region has been severely transformed, being dominated by large-scale monocultures of citrus at the Andean piedmont, followed by non-flowering crops of sugar cane and soybean. Here, we aim to study how non-cultivated areas within citrus farms can boost pollinators’ diversity. Specifically, we want to assess how different facets of pollinator diversity are affected by floral resources (composition and abundance), crop margins, and natural areas. Moreover, we aim to disentangle the mechanisms promoting pollinators pollinators persistence within the crop.\nThis project is conducted in partnership with the NGO Proyungas and lead by Dr. Natacha Chacoff, Dr. Carolina Monmmany, Dr. Roxana Aragón, and me.\n\nSelected publications (only those were I played a significant role)\n\nMonasterologo, M, Ramírez-Mejía A.

Tucumán, Argentina.\n\n\nPollination management in pollinator-dependent crops generally depends on beehives stocked at variable densities. Farmers typically seek to saturate crop flowers with pollinators, while giving little consideration to how different stocking densities actually affect flower-visitation rates and optimal pollination levels depending on the mating crop system. Such an approach would be unthinkable in the case of other crop inputs. Still, although pollination is crucial for securing crop yields and profits, its management is generally based on much more ambiguous criteria, leading to uncertainties about its outcome and actual benefits. In this project, I aim to combine different modeling techniques to predict blueberry production based on the strength, density, and spatial arrangement of honeybee hives on the farm, honeybee pollination effectiveness, and optimal levels and patterns of pollen deposition in the crop.\nThis project was part of a past postdoctoral work under the supervision of Dr. Pedro G. Blendinger and Dr. Natacha Chacoff.\n\nSelected publications (only those were I played a significant role)\n\nRamírez-Mejía A. F., Chacoff N., Cavigliasso P., Blendinger P. (2024).
