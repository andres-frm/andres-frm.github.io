### Hi!

I'm a Ph.D candidate in Biological Sciences at the National University of Tucumán in Argentina. I was born in Colombia and started my career hoping to become an agronomist, but somehow I ended up as a biologist interested in mammalian ecology. In 2018 I got a CONICET fellowship to study crop pollination at Northwestern Argentina; since then, I have been enjoying asado, mate, empanadas and, of course, the 40 Celsius degrees during Tucumán's summer.

I built this website to share my work and my general interests outside academic formality. 

### My current research

My research is focused on the patterns and mechanisms explaining the contribution of wild and managed species to the pollination of blueberries in the NOA. I'm mainly studying: the effect of animal pollination on several productive metrics of the crop; optimal pollination thresholds to maximize blueberry production; individual and population effectiveness of pollinators; and cascading processes affecting pollination service in blueberry crops.

### My research interests

-   Crop pollination
-   Pollination ecology
-   Mammalian ecology
-   Functional diversity
-   Statistics
-   R programming

I'm interested in understanding how spatial patterns modulate the functional responses of animals and the resulting effect on ecosystem processes and services.

### What I like/love

-   Biking
-   Reading (Dostoyevski, García Márquez, Sábato, and Vasili Grossman are personal friends)
-   Asado, or BBQ in english (Despite the ethical conflict inside me, I'm a big meat eater)
-   Dark beer (preferably Stout)
-   Animals in general, but particularly bats, cats and dogs.
