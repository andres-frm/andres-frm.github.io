### Hi!

I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the  [Vizentin-Bogoni Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/vizentinbugoni/) (Institute of Biology, UFPel) in Pelotas (RS), Brazil. I was born in Colombia and started my career hoping to become an agronomist, but somehow I ended up as a biologist interested in community ecology, species interaction, ecosystem processes and ecological modeling.

I created this website to share my work and my general interests outside academic formality.

### Current research

I am interested in using quantitative methods and field experiments to study how spatial and temporal patterns affect biodiversity, species interactions and the consequences for ecosystem processes. Currently, I'm mainly involve in two projects : [Army Ant Followers Project](https://www.tarwaterlab.com/copy-of-panama-plumas-project), and [Hawaii-VINE. Project](https://www.tarwaterlab.com/hawaii-vine-project).

### Research interests

-   Functional diversity and ecosystem services
-   Community ecology
-   Species interactions
-   Pollinators and mammal ecology
-   R programming
-   Data science
-   Bayesian statistics

### What I like

-   Biking.
-   Literature (Dostoyevski, García Márquez, Sábato, and Vasili Grossman are personal friends).
-   Asado --BBQ in english.
-   Dark beer.
-   Animals in general, but particularly pollinators, bats, cats and dogs.
