### Hi!

I'm a postdoctoral researcher of [CONICET](https://www.conicet.gov.ar) at the [Institute of Regional Ecology](https://ier.conicet.gov.ar) in Tucumán, Argentina. I was born in Colombia and started my career hoping to become an agronomist, but somehow I ended up as a biologist interested in mammalian ecology. In 2018 I got a Ph.D. fellowship to study crop pollination at Northwestern Argentina; since then, I have been enjoying asado, mate, empanadas and, of course, the 40 °C during Tucumán's summer.

I created this website to share my work and my general interests outside academic formality.

### Current research

I am interested in combining different modeling approaches and field experiments to understand how spatial patterns affect biodiversity and ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes. Currently, I'm mainly involve in two projects : **(i)** *developing a control system for pollination service management in blueberry crops*, and **(ii)** *assessing how low opportunity cost areas in large-scale monoculture of citrus can boost taxonomic and functional diversity of pollinators*.

### Research interests

-   Functional diversity and ecosystem services
-   Pollinators and mammals
-   Landscape ecology
-   Experimental design
-   Data science
-   Statistical programming

### What I like/love

-   Biking.
-   Literature (Dostoyevski, García Márquez, Sábato, and Vasili Grossman are personal friends).
-   Asado --BBQ in english.
-   Dark beer.
-   Animals in general, but particularly bats, cats and dogs.
