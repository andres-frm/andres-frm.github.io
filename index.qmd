### Hi!

I'm postdoctoral researcher of [CONICET](https://www.conicet.gov.ar) at the [Institute of Regional Ecology](https://ier.conicet.gov.ar) in Tucumán, Argentina. I was born in Colombia and started my career hoping to become an agronomist, but somehow I ended up as a biologist interested in mammalian ecology. In 2018 I got a Ph.D. fellowship by CONICET to study crop pollination at Northwestern Argentina; since then, I have been enjoying asado, mate, empanadas and, of course, the 40 °C during Tucumán's summer.

I built this website to share my work and my general interests outside academic formality.

### My current research

Currently, I am interested in combining different modeling approaches and field experiments to understand how spatial patterns affect biodiversity and ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes of Northern Argentina. I'm mainly studying: the effect of animal pollination on several productive metrics of the crop; optimal pollination thresholds to maximize blueberry production; individual and population effectiveness of pollinators; and cascading processes affecting pollination service in blueberry crops.

### My research interests

-   Crop pollination
-   Pollination ecology
-   Bats
-   Functional diversity
-   Statistics
-   R programming

I'm interested in understanding how spatial patterns modulate the functional responses of animals and the resulting effect on ecosystem processes.

### What I like/love

-   Biking.
-   Reading (Dostoyevski, García Márquez, Sábato, and Vasili Grossman are personal friends).
-   Asado --or BBQ in english-- (Despite the ethical conflict inside me, I'm a big meat eater).
-   Dark beer (preferably Stout).
-   Animals in general, but particularly bats, cats and dogs.
